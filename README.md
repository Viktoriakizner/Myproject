Project Title: Online Camping Equipment Store
Project Description:
This project presents the design and development of an e-commerce system for selling camping and outdoor equipment. The platform offers a user-friendly interface for both customers and administrators, enabling full management of products, orders, and user accounts.

The system allows customers to browse through various camping products such as tents, lanterns, backpacks, cooking kits, and more. Each product is displayed with a detailed description, current stock availability, price in shekels (â‚ª), and high-quality images. Customers can register, log in, add items to their cart, place orders, and submit product reviews.

On the administrative side, the platform includes several dedicated management interfaces: product manager, order manager, customer support, and review moderation. These roles are separated to ensure clear responsibility and a scalable workflow.

The store supports full e-commerce functionality including shopping cart, checkout, and order tracking. The system emphasizes a responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices, and ensures data privacy, secure login, and a streamlined user experience.

This project showcases the integration of backend logic, database structure (relational model), user interface design, and system analysis, while meeting real-world functional and operational requirements.
